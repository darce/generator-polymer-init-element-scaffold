### DEVELOPMENT

During development there are 3 pages you might be interested in.
 - The root page is there to display the documentation.
 - The `/demo` page is there to display various demos for how to use your component.
 - The `/implementation` page, is a sandbox where you can work with less noise compared to the demo page.

**Running Your Project**

 - `npm start` is the default command to spin your project. It will clean up any old builds
 and then start up a development server on port `3000`  using [Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io/) to reload the page when changes occur.

**note:** If you are finding that when reloading it is switching from demos back to docs, then in the browser add the route `/demo` to the url and then the refreshes will happen on that route.

 **note:** Make sure you are using [Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/canary.html) for development
<% } %>

**Deploying your Project**

- `npm run pages` is the command to deploy a [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) site for your project [https://<%=orgName%>.github.io/<%=elementName%>](https://<%=orgName%>.github.io/<%=elementName%>)

**note:**
  - This creates a orphan branch with no history.
  - Always run this from `master` after pulling the latest build to ensure your docs reflect
  the most recent version.

**Testing Your Project**

- `npm run test` is the command to run basic tests using [Web Component Tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester) in the terminal.

Automated testing is also supported with [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/getting_started). If you enable this feature on the Github repo then tests are set to run on every commit. This can be adjusted in the `.travis.yml`<% if (sauceLabs === true) { %>

We also support greater cross browser support with testing from [SauceLabs](https://saucelabs.com/). These are currently built to run on every pull request.

To add more VMs to `wtc.conf.json` if you would like to increase your cross browser coverage.
